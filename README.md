Generic Command line youtube to mp3 converter/with colorama

Honestly, pytube has so many bugs its currently (as of 3/19/23) unusable. The bugs are very annoying. 
func_regex = re.compile(r"function\([^)]?\)")? nah bruh
going to attempt this project with a different library. 
I'm thinking https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp/

`pip install colorama`
`pip install pytube`
`pip install os-sys`
